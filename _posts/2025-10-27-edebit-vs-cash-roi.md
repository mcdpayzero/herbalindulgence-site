# eDebit vs. Cash: Calculating ROI for Cannabis Growers

Enter eDebit—bank-direct payments that slash costs and integrate seamlessly with METRC. At Herbal Indulgence, our POS hardware pairs with Green.Money for fraud-proof transactions, turning a liability into a profit center.

Ditch cash hassles—eDebit cuts handling costs by 40% while ensuring PCI-DSS compliance. Learn the math behind bank-direct payments via Green.Money, METRC tie-ins, and hardware setups for farm offices. Real grower case studies show payback in 3 months.

## The ROI Math: Cash vs. eDebit
- **Cash Costs**: $0.50/transaction in labor + 5% shrinkage from errors/theft = $5,000/year for a small farm.
- **eDebit Savings**: Flat 2.9% + $0.30 fee via Green.Money = $3,500/year net gain (no cash transport).
- **METRC Bonus**: Auto-tie payments to tags—reduces audit time by 50%, worth $2,000 in labor.

## Tips for Growers Transitioning
- **Calculate Your Break-Even**: Use our formula: (Annual sales x 0.029) - cash handling costs. Most see ROI in 90 days.
- **Hardware Setup**: Deploy rugged scanners in farm offices—syncs eDebit with inventory for METRC compliance.
- **Case Study**: A Colorado grower saved $12K in year 1 by switching—fewer errors, faster payouts.
- **Scale Tip**: Start with Basic plan ($29/mo)—add Pro for unlimited eDebit.
