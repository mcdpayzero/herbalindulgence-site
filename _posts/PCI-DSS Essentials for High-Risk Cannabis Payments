# PCI-DSS Essentials for High-Risk Cannabis Payments

In the cannabis space, high-risk classification amplifies PCI-DSS scrutiny—data breaches can cost $4.5M on average. But with the right POS, compliance becomes a competitive edge. Herbal Indulgence's hardware and Green.Money eDebit ensure encrypted, bank-direct flows that meet standards without slowing sales.

High-risk doesn't mean high vulnerability—lock down transactions with end-to-end encryption. This guide covers PCI basics, why Green.Money's fraud-proof eDebit shines, and POS hardware tweaks for dispensaries. Avoid breaches and scale securely.

## PCI-DSS Core Requirements
- **Protect Cardholder Data**: Use tokenization in Green.Money—no storage on your POS.
- **Access Controls**: Role-based logins on 15" terminals limit exposure.
- **Regular Testing**: Quarterly scans built into our software—alerts for vulnerabilities.

## Tips for Dispensary Implementation
- **Start Small**: Enable eDebit on one terminal—test PCI scans free with our bundle.
- **Integrate with METRC**: Link payments to inventory tags for dual compliance.
- **Train for Speed**: Staff can process in <10s—rugged design minimizes errors.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Zero cash = zero theft; case study: 60% fraud drop.
